# UNAVU
# Problem Statement:
Every day, huge amounts of perfectly edible food from weddings, hotels, and events are wasted, while nearby people go hungry.
The problem is not food availability — it is the lack of a fast, trusted, and local coordination system between food donors and volunteers.

# Solution:
UNAVU is a simple web platform that instantly connects food donors with verified nearby volunteers.
Donors post surplus food details in seconds. Volunteers receive real-time requests, accept pickups, and deliver food safely using OTP-based confirmation to ensure trust and accountability.

# Innovation:
What makes UNAVU innovative is its speed, simplicity, and trust model.
No complex setup, no middlemen — just direct coordination, real-time status tracking, and secure OTP verification.
UNAVU turns food rescue into a fast, reliable, and scalable community action.

# Impact:
With UNAVU, surplus food is not wasted — it reaches care, dignity, and people in need.

# Tagline:
UNAVU – From Excess to Care.
